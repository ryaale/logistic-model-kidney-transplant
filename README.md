# Logisitc model for Kidney transplant success

The goal of this analysis is to model the probability of graft failure in kidney transplants, using a dataset of 1158 patients. The predictor variables include the binary variables, sex of the patient (male), presence of cardio-vascular problems (cardio). The continuous predictor variables include the age of the patient (age), haematocrit level before the transplant (HC).

# Summary

As indicated by the poor predictive quality of the final model (Nagelkerke's R^2=~0.05), it is recommended to include more information in the model. The first variable that should be included is the sex of the patient who provided the transplanted kidney. Without this variable, the sex of the patient is only half the story.
Core factors that influence graft rejection are the age of the patient: The older the patient, the higher the probability of success of the transplant.
